# Chapter 1 - Introduction

FastApp is a web application designed as an example of a Python-based web app built using the **fasthtml** library. It focuses on managing users, clients, and contacts to showcase a variety of features provided by **fasthtml**.

### Project Objective

To facilitate the creation of an admin interface with efficient, responsive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, organized according to principles like MVC and component reuse.

### Target Audience

Developers or technical teams looking to build complex interfaces without relying on frontend frameworks such as React or Vue, taking advantage of a clear backend-driven architecture.  
As a developer, I have previously worked with other frameworks (such as `Flask`, `FastAPI`, or `Django`) and I recognize that **fasthtml** approaches development in a more effective and straightforward way.
